        <h1>Tools of the Trade</h1>
        <h3> Okay, you've bought your brand-new copy of Beethoven "Eroica." Now what? The tools you use to mark your score are essential to transform your musical thoughts to notes to effective conducting. Using the right tools can make the journey smoother.

                Are all pencils created equal? Not quite. <a class="buy" href="https://blackwing602.com/products/blackwing-pencils-set-of-12-legacy?_pos=1&_sid=4095c9245&_ss=r" target="_blank">The Palomino Blackwing</a> 
                is the gold standard for all score markings. It is the perfect darkness to provide contrast, and soft enough that you won't need to push too hard on fragile pages. The moveable eraser ferrule is a nice touch. No wonder they were a favorite of Leonard Bernstein!

                These <a class="buy" href="https://www.amazon.com/Pilot-Retractable-Erasable-Assorted-Disappear/dp/B009QYH644" target="_blank">pens by Pilot FriXion</a> solve the age old problem of wanting to mark with color, but not to commit these marks for a lifetime; these colors fully erase! This particular pack contains 7 colors, but obviously choose what colors you need for your personal marking system.

                Creating straight, clear, lines keeps your scores looking fresh and uncluttered. I reccomend using <a class="buy" href=https://www.amazon.com/Plastic-Straight-Measuring-Mathematical-Geometry/dp/B07HNJHSSY/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=clear+ruler+8+inch&qid=1587680364&s=office-products&sr=1-3 target="_blank"> a clear ruler.</a>
                The transparency shows exactly where your lines will be. An 8" ruler fits easily in a pencil case, but is also large enough to cover multiple staves.
